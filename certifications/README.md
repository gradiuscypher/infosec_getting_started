# Certifications

There are mixed opinions on certification within InfoSec - some are good, while many are complete crap. Regardless of your opinion, below are some links that may of interest for you to dig through yourself (don't listen to crap from _Dark Reading_).

# List of Certifications
**1. SANS & GIAC
As SANS themselves says - "Information security training, network & cyber security training, certification, and research in cyber defense, pentesting, ethical hacking, digital forensics." Some of the courses are still really great and regularly updated, while others haven't changed for quite a while and feel like money spinners :-/ They do have some amazing instructors and very smart folk, but be warned, it's not cheap. While SANS do run courses worldwide, their major market with most options and courses annually is the US.

SANS offers course in on-premise, physically (at a Sans conference) and online.

Certifications for SANS courses are through [GIAC](https://www.giac.org) and their gold-standard, master certification, the [GSE](http://www.giac.org/certification/security-expert-gse), is their only hands-on certification involving 3 certs, papers, a minimum of 4 multiple-choice tests and a 2-day lab.
